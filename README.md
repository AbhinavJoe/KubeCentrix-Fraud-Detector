## Problem Statement

Online fraud is a growing concern, with fraudulent websites, misleading advertisements, and fake customer care numbers causing harm to users. The challenge is to develop an Automated AI/ML System that can detect and mitigate online fraud by analyzing and categorizing online content in real-time.

## Objective

The goal of is to create and implement an AI/ML-based system capable of autonomously analyzing and distinguishing between authentic and fraudulent online content. The system should cover three key aspects:

1. **Website Authentication:**

   - Develop algorithms to assess the legitimacy of websites based on domain, SSL certificates, and other authentication indicators.

2. **Ad Content Analysis:**

   - Implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) and image recognition techniques to evaluate the authenticity and accuracy of ad content.

3. **Customer Care Number Verification:**

   - Establish a database of verified customer care numbers and compare incoming numbers to identify potential scams.

4. **Real-time Detection:**

   - Enable real-time analysis of online content to prevent users from accessing fake or malicious websites.

5. **User Feedback Integration:**
   - Incorporate mechanisms for user feedback to enhance the system's accuracy and adapt to evolving fraudulent tactics.
