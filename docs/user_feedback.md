# User Feedback Collection Script

This Python script allows users to provide feedback for a website and stores the feedback in a JSON file.

## Script Overview

The script prompts the user to enter the URL of a website and their feedback. It then updates an existing JSON file (or creates a new one if it doesn't exist) with the user's feedback.

## Usage

1. Run the script.

2. Enter the website URL and provide feedback when prompted.

3. The script will update the JSON file with the user's feedback.

## Code Explanation

- The script uses the `input()` function to get the user's input for the website URL and feedback.

- It constructs the path for the JSON file to store feedback, allowing for easy modification of the file path.

- If the JSON file exists, it reads the existing feedback data; otherwise, it initializes an empty dictionary.

- The script then updates the dictionary with the new feedback, where the website URL is used as the key and the feedback as the value.

- The updated data is written back to the JSON file with an indentation of 4 spaces for better readability.

## Running the Script

```bash
python user_feedback.py
```

## Output

The script will generate a JSON file named UserFeedback.json (or update an existing one) containing the user feedback.

## Example

For example, after running the script with the input:

```plaintext
Enter the URL of the website: www.example.com
Please provide feedback for the website: Great content and user-friendly design.
The JSON file will be updated with the entry:
```

```json
{
  "www.example.com": "Great content and user-friendly design."
}
```
